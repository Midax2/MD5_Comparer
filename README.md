Bash MD5 Comparer

Comparing files and directories using the MD5 checksum.

The script compares two files or two directories using MD5 checksums.

If two files are provided, the script calculates the MD5 checksums for each file and compares them. If the checksums are the same, the script displays the message "Files are identical"; otherwise, it displays "Files are different". If two directories are provided, the script calculates the MD5 checksums for each file in each directory, sorts them, and then calculates the MD5 checksum for the entire set of files. If the checksums are the same, the script displays the message "Directories are identical"; otherwise, it displays "Directories are different". If the arguments are not two files or two directories, the script displays an appropriate error message and terminates.
